## Personal Notes

Starting off my project. First commit here to test.

After a full day of being out, I came home and finished out my code for the first section. This first section actually helped a lot because I was able to create my own div containers to really see how everything should be aligned and placed. I feel as if there is a lot of useless code/rewritten code but I will clean it up after the final finished project. For now, the header/top section is finished.

Fully finished. I completed two sections today, which was the remaining middle and bottom section. Middle section was easy due to the exercises we went through. The bottom section was also easy, although I would love to find out how to make the button at the bottom better. All that is left is to add a footer.
