After a full day of being out, I came home and finished out my code for the first section. This first section actually helped a lot because I was able to create my own div containers to really see how everything should be aligned and placed. I feel as if there is a lot of useless code/rewritten code but I will clean it up after the final finished project. For now, the header/top section is finished.
